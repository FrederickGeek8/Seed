# Project Seed
Cushing Academy Investment Competition open-sourced.

# What is this?
After the online stock market simulator, WeSeed shut down, I was approached by a former student of Cushing Academy, asking if I could create a similar platform. However, he requested that the platform also allow for school to compete against each other in a "stock market competition".
This project is what came out of that conversation. It is a fully-featured stock market simulation in which several school competed throughout my time at that Cushing Academy.

After several years of development, I decided to shut down and open-source the project. Perhaps I will compile a list of its features, but it is really up to you to find out.
